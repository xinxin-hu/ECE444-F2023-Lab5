#### What are the pros and cons of TDD?
Pros:\
    - Since TDD is one of the software testing techniques and unit tests are implemented before application development, it significantly reduces defect rates\
    - Reduced defect rate also substantially decreases the amount of effort required in the final development phase of the project.\
    - TDD make application refactory easier since existing tests that validate functional behaviour remains consistent\
    - TDD ensures that significant portion of the code undergoes testing\
    - TDD serves as a form of documentation, developers can understand functional behaviour of the application by reading/ running the test\
Cons:\
    - Writing tests before code can be time-consuming\
    - As codebases evolves larger, it becomes harder to maintain and update the tests\
    - TDD does not guarantee that all edge cases will be covered. There is no systematic way of helping developers when they omit some scenarios in their tests\
    - TDD software design pattern focus more on the feature level, so it is very easy for developers to disregard large or medium-scale design\
